Throughout the book, we will be creating plots using the **ggplot2** package.

```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
```

Many other approaches are available for creating plots in R. In fact, the plotting capabilities that come with a basic installation of R are already quite powerful. There are also other packages for creating graphics such as **grid** and **lattice**. We chose to use <span class="blue">ggplot2 in this book because it breaks plots into components in a way that permits beginners to create relatively complex and aesthetically pleasing plots using syntax that is intuitive and comparatively easy to remember.</span>

One reason **ggplot2** is generally more intuitive for beginners is that it uses a grammar of graphics23, the `gg` in **ggplot2**. 

One limitation is that <span class="blue>**ggplot2** is designed to work exclusively with data tables in tidy format</span> (where rows are observations and columns are variables). However, a substantial percentage of datasets that beginners work with are in, or can be converted into, this format. An advantage of this approach is that, assuming that our data is tidy, ggplot2 simplifies plotting code and the learning of grammar for a variety of plots.

# 8.1 The components of a graph

We will construct a graph that summarizes the US `murders` dataset that looks like this:

<img src="http://rafalab.dfci.harvard.edu/dsbook/book_files/figure-html/ggplot-example-plot-1.png" />

We can clearly see how much states vary across population size and the total number of murders. Not surprisingly, we also see a clear relationship between murder totals and population size. A state falling on the dashed grey line has the same murder rate as the US average. The four geographic regions are denoted with color, which depicts how most southern states have murder rates above the average.

This data visualization shows us pretty much all the information in the data table. The code needed to make this plot is relatively simple. We will learn to create the plot part by part.

The first step in learning **ggplot2** is to be able to break a graph apart into components. Let’s break down the plot above and introduce some of the **ggplot2** terminology. The main three components to note are:

- **Data**: The US murders data table is being summarized. We refer to this as the **data** component.
- **Geometry**: The plot above is a scatterplot. This is referred to as the **geometry** component. Other possible geometries are barplot, histogram, smooth densities, qqplot, and boxplot. We will learn more about these in the Data Visualization part of the book.
- **Aesthetic mapping**: The plot uses several visual cues to represent the information provided by the dataset. The two most important cues in this plot are the point positions on the x-axis and y-axis, which represent population size and the total number of murders, respectively. Each point represents a different observation, and we map data about these observations to visual cues like x- and y-scale. Color is another visual cue that we map to region. We refer to this as the **aesthetic mapping** component. How we define the mapping depends on what **geometry** we are using.

We also note that:

- The points are labeled with the state abbreviations.
- The range of the x-axis and y-axis appears to be defined by the range of the data. They are both on log-scales.
- There are labels, a title, a legend, and we use the style of The Economist magazine.
We will now construct the plot piece by piece.

We start by loading the dataset:

```{r}
library(dslabs)
data(murders)
```

# 8.2 `ggplot` objects

The first step in creating a **ggplot2** graph is to define a `ggplot` object. We do this with the function <span id="ggplot">`ggplot()`</span> which initializes the graph. If we read the help file for this function, we see that the first argument is used to specify what data is associated with this object:

```
ggplot(data = murders)
```
or
```{r}
murders |> ggplot()
```
It renders a plot, in this case a blank slate since no geometry has been defined. The only style choice we see is a grey background.

What has happened above is that the object was created and, because it was not assigned, it was automatically evaluated. But we can assign our plot to an object, for example like this:

```{r}
p <- ggplot(data = murders)
class(p)
```
To render the plot associated with this object, we simply print the object `p`. The following two lines of code each produce the same plot we see above:
```
print(p)
p
```

# 8.3 Geometries

In **ggplot2** we <span class="blue">create graphs by adding layers</span>. Layers can define geometries, compute summary statistics, define what scales to use, or even change styles. To add layers, we use the symbol `+`. In general, a line of code will look like this:

<blockquote>
DATA |> ggplot() + LAYER 1 + LAYER 2 + … + LAYER N
</blockquoate

Usually, <span class="blue">the first added layer defines the geometry.</span> We want to make a scatterplot. What geometry do we use? Taking a quick look at the cheat sheet, we see that the function used to create plots with this geometry is **`geom_point`**.

Geometry function names follow the pattern: `geom_X` where X is the name of the geometry. Some examples include `geom_point`, `geom_bar`, and `geom_histogram`.

For <span id="geom_point">`geom_point`</span> to run properly we need to provide data and a mapping. We have already connected the object `p` with the `murders` data table, and if we add the layer `geom_point` it defaults to using this data. To find out what mappings are expected, we read the **Aesthetics** section of the help file geom_point help file:
<blockquote>
geom_point() understands the following aesthetics (required aesthetics are in bold):

- **x**
- **y**
- alpha
- colour
- fill
- group
- shape
- size
- stroke
</blockquote>
and, as expected, we see that at least two arguments are required `x` and `y`.

# 8.4 Aesthetic mappings

**Aesthetic mappings** describe how properties of the data connect with features of the graph, such as distance along an axis, size, or color. The <span id="aes">**`aes`**</span> function connects data with what we see on the graph by defining aesthetic mappings and will be one of the functions you use most often when plotting. The outcome of the `aes` function is often used as the argument of a geometry function. This example produces a scatterplot of total murders versus population in millions:
```
murders |> ggplot() + 
  geom_point(aes(x = population/10^6, y = total))
```
We can drop the `x =` and `y =` if we wanted to since these are the first and second expected arguments, as seen in the help page.

Instead of defining our plot from scratch, we can also add a layer to the p object that was defined above as `p <- ggplot(data = murders)`:
```{r}
p + geom_point(aes(population / 10^6, total))
```
The scale and labels are defined by default when adding this layer. Like **dplyr** functions, `aes` also uses the variable names from the object component: we can use `population` and `total` without having to call them as `murders$population` and `murders$total`. The behavior of recognizing the variables from the data component is quite specific to `aes`. <span class="blue">With most functions, if you try to access the values of population or total outside of `aes` you receive an error.</span>

# 8.5 Layers

A second layer in the plot we wish to make involves adding a label to each point to identify the state. The <span id="geom_label">`geom_label`</span> and <span id="geom_text">`geom_text`</span> functions permit us to add text to the plot with and without a rectangle behind the text, respectively.

Because each point (each state in this case) has a label, we need an aesthetic mapping to make the connection between points and labels. By reading the help file, we learn that we supply the mapping between point and label through the `label` argument of `aes`. 
<blockquote>
Aesthetics

`geom_text()` understands the following aesthetics (required aesthetics are in bold):

- **x**
- **y**
- **label**
- alpha
- angle
- colour
- family
- fontface
- group
- hjust
- lineheight
- size
- vjust
</blockquote>
So the code looks like this:

```{r}
p + 
  geom_point(aes(population / 10^6, total)) +
  geom_text(aes(population / 10^6,
                total,
                label = abb))
```
As an example of the unique behavior of aes mentioned above, note that this call:
```
p_test <- p + geom_text(aes(population/10^6, total, label = abb))
```
is fine, whereas this call:
```
p_test <- p + geom_text(aes(population/10^6, total), label = abb) 
```
will give you an error since abb is not found because it is outside of the aes function. The layer geom_text does not know where to find abb since it is a column name and not a global variable.

## 8.5.1 Tinkering with arguments

Each geometry function has many arguments other than `aes` and `data`. They tend to be specific to the function. For example, in the plot we wish to make, the points are larger than the default size. In the help file we see that `size` is an aesthetic and we can change it like this:

```{r}
p + 
  geom_point(aes(population / 10^6, 
                 total),
             size = 3) +
  geom_text(aes(population / 10^6,
                total,
                label = abb))
```
<span class="blue">`size` is not a mapping: whereas mappings use data from specific observations and need to be inside aes(), operations we want to affect all the points the same way do not need to be included inside aes.</span>

Now because the points are larger it is hard to see the labels. If we read the help file for `geom_text`, we see the `nudge_x` argument, which moves the text slightly to the right or to the left:

```{r}
p + 
  geom_point(aes(population / 10^6, 
                 total),
             size = 3) +
  geom_text(aes(population / 10^6,
                total,
                label = abb),
            nudge_x = 1.5)
```
This is preferred as it makes it easier to read the text. In Section 8.11 we learn a better way of assuring we can see the points and the labels.

# 8.6 Global versus local aesthetic mappings

In the previous line of code, we define the mapping `aes(population/10^6, total)` twice, once in each geometry. We can avoid this by using a global aesthetic mapping. We can do this when we define the blank slate ggplot object. Remember that the function ggplot contains an argument that permits us to define aesthetic mappings:
```{r}
args(ggplot)
```
If we define a mapping in `ggplot`, all the geometries that are added as layers will default to this mapping. We redefine `p`:
```{r}
murders |> 
  ggplot(aes(population / 10^6, 
             total, 
             label = abb)) -> p
```

and then we can simply write the following code to produce the previous plot:
```{r}
p +
  geom_point(size = 3) +
  geom_text(nudge_x = 1.5)
```
We keep the `size` and `nudge_x` arguments in `geom_point` and `geom_text`, respectively, because we want to only increase the size of points and only nudge the labels. <span class="blue">If we put those arguments in aes then they would apply to both plots. Also note that the geom_point function does not need a label argument and therefore ignores that aesthetic.</span>

If necessary, we can override the global mapping by defining a new mapping within each layer. These **local** definitions override the global. Here is an example:

```{r}
p +
  geom_point(size = 3) +
  geom_text(aes(x = 10,
                y = 800,
                label = "Hello there!"))
```
Clearly, the second call to `geom_text` does not use `population` and `total`.

# 8.7 Scales

First, our desired scales are in log-scale. This is not the default, so this change needs to be added through a **scales** layer. A quick look at the cheat sheet reveals the <span id="sx_c">`scale_x_continuous`</span> and <span id="sy_c">`scale_y_continuous`</span> function lets us control the behavior of scales. We use them like this:
```{r}
p +
  geom_point(size = 3) +
  geom_text(nudge_x = 0.05) +
  scale_x_continuous(trans = "log10") +
  scale_y_continuous(trans = "log10")
```
<span class="blue">Because we are in the log-scale now, the nudge must be made smaller.</span>

This particular transformation is so common that **ggplot2** provides the specialized functions <span id="sx_log10>`scale_x_log10`</span> and <span id="sy_log10`>scale_y_log10`</span>, which we can use to rewrite the code like this:

```{r}
p +
  geom_point(size = 3) +
  geom_text(nudge_x = 0.05) +
  scale_x_log10() +
  scale_y_log10()
```
